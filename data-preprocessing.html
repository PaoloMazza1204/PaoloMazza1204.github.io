            Data preprocessing is a critical step in Machine Learning. Also,
            it's one of the first steps when building a model, so I figured it
            would be a great place to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this section, I show you my first look at data preprocessing
            under the gaze of Machine Learning. I discuss data inspection and
            its importance, attribute selection and I also show you three really
            basic ways of handling missing values on datasets. All of this using
            <a href="https://rapidminer.com/">RapidMiner Studio</a> and its wide
            variety of useful operators.
          </p>

          <h2>Dataset Inspection</h2>

          <p>
            The first step when solving a problem is gaining knowledge about it,
            understanding it and its parameters, as well as recognizing what a
            complete solution should include or even look like; the process
            involved in building a Machine Learning model is no exception. This
            is, precisely, why data inspection is such a decisive and thus
            important step; first, we must get to know what data we have, its
            strucure, the attributes involved in the problem and their types, as
            well as what they represent or mean in the context of the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            In RapidMiner Studio, inspecting data is a really simple task. Once
            we have access to the dataset involved in the problem, we can easily
            import it to a repository and then retrieve it using the
            <strong>retrieve</strong> operator. After connecting the output port
            of the retrieve operator to the output of the process being built,
            we can take a look at some highlights of the dataset, statistics,
            and more. The following image shows how to create a process that
            retrieves the Titanic dataset found in the
            <strong>/samples/data</strong> folder in RapidMiner Studio:
          </p>

          <div class="image container">
            <img
              class="image fit"
              src="/images/data-pre-processing-retrieve.png"
              alt="A RapidMiner Studio process with a Retrieve operator connected to the output port."
            />
          </div>

          <p>By running the previous process we see the following results:</p>

          <div class="image container">
            <img
              class="image fit big"
              src="/images/data-pre-processing-retrieve-result.png"
              alt="The result of the previous process."
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            And as simple as that, we can already see a lot of useful
            information, i.e, that the dataset has 1309 examples, we can see all
            the attributes and their types, as well as the amount of missing
            values, and statistics like minimum, maximum, least, most, average,
            etc. Also, by selecting an attribute we can take a look at its
            distribution, which is super helpful to determine if we should do a
            transformation, in the event that the model we plan to use expects
            the attributes to have a Gaussian like distribution.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this particular example, one of the things we notice is the big
            amount of missing values for the Cabin attribute; there are 1014 out
            of 1309 examples with a missing value for this attribute, this is
            approximately 78%! We'll definitely have to handle this someway
            before feeding it to the model. In addition, Age seems to have 263
            missing values, not as much as Cabin, but truly something
            considerable.
          </p>

          <p>
            All this information extraction and more, we can do with just taking
            a look at the statistics tab, but we can actually see the statistics
            via graphics in the <strong>Visualizations</strong> tab, which
            provides us with a lot of different graphs that can help us
            understand more about the data and its attributes' distributions and
            relations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notice that I did't mention the 823 missing values for the Life Boat
            attribute when discussing the missing values. This is because we can
            clearly see that this attribute shouldn't be included in the model,
            because it's highly correlated with the Survived attribute. This
            makes sense if you think about it, due to the fact that those who
            don't have a Life Boat assigned (missing value), didn't reach the
            moment at which they get to one, sadly. But also notice that having
            a life boat assigned doesn't imply survival necessarily. All of this
            important reasoning wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for problem
            understanding, data understanding and, at the end of the day, data
            inspection.
          </p>

          <h2>Attribute Selection</h2>

          <p>
            After understanding the problem and its parameters involved, we are
            in proper conditions to start pruning the dataset in order to
            benefit our model. Attribute selection is one of the next steps
            after retrieving a dataset, and it means just that: selecting
            attributes. Basically, by selecting attributes we discard the ones
            that we consider are irrelevant, or maybe we actually think that a
            specific attribute is relevant, but it has too many missing values,
            as is the case of Cabin. Selecting attributes in RapidMiner Studio
            is as simple as inserting a
            <strong>Select Attributes</strong> operator in the process and
            properly connecting it. Based on the previous RapidMiner Studio
            process, we would insert this operator like so:
          </p>

          <div class="image container">
            <img
              class="image fit"
              src="/images/data-pre-processing-select.png"
              alt="The previous RapidMiner Studio process with the addition of the Select operator"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Playing a bit with the operator's parameters, we can select just one
            attribute, a subset, the ones that match a regular expression, etc.
            In our example, we could select a subset of attributes,
            specifically, all but Cabin and Life Boat, following the reasoning
            so far.
          </p>

          <h2>Techniques to Handle Missing Values</h2>

          <p>
            When it comes to handling missing values, there are different
            techniques we can make use of, here, I show how we would do three
            really basic ones: Attribute Removal, Imputation and Examples
            Filtering.
          </p>

          <h3>Attribute Removal</h3>

          <p>
            This technique should sound familiar, especially because I just
            talked about Attribute selection. Inherently, when we are selecting
            attributes, we are getting rid of the ones we are not selecting. So,
            just like attribute selection helps us to get rid of the attributes
            we don't perceive as helpful or relevant, it's also a way of getting
            rid of attributes that have too many missing values.
          </p>

          <h3>Imputation</h3>

          <p>
            Basically, imputation consists of replacing missing values for a
            valid one. This replacement value could be the mean, mode, minimum,
            maximum, a specificied one or even the k-nn, amongst others.
          </p>

          <p>
            To replace missing values in RapidMiner Studio, there's the operator
            named
            <strong>Replace Missing Values</strong>. Following the example
            process so far, we could add it after selecting attributes, like so:
          </p>

          <div class="image container">
            <img
              class="image fit"
              src="/images/data-pre-processing-replace.png"
              alt="The previous RapidMiner Studio process with the addition of the Replace Missing Values operator."
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            This operator lets us replace the missing values for a specific
            attribute, a subset of them, amongs other options like using a regex
            to match the attribute's name. As we can see in the following image,
            the <strong>Replace Missing Values</strong> operator lets us replace
            the missing values with the mean, minimum, maximum, zero, or we can
            even specify a value.
          </p>

          <div class="image container">
            <img
              class="image fit"
              src="/images/data-pre-processing-replace-parameters.png"
              alt="The parameters of the Replace Missing Values operator."
            />
          </div>

          <h3>Examples Filtering</h3>

          <p>
            Filtering examples is another way of handling missing values. This
            technique consists of getting rid of the examples that have missing
            values. As you can imagine, it's something that we would generally
            avoid, as getting rid of examples equals getting rid of information,
            and generally, the more information, the better. Nevertheless, it
            can be useful since not all the machine learning algorithms can
            handle missing values. In RapidMiner Studio, we can filter examples
            with the operator <strong>Filter Examples</strong>, which would be
            attached to the process we've worked on so far, just like so:
          </p>

          <div class="image container">
            <img
              class="image fit"
              src="/images/data-pre-processing-filter-examples.png"
              alt="The previous RapidMiner Studio process with the addition of the Filter Examples operator."
            />
          </div>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            These were my first steps on data preprocessing. We discussed the
            importance of understanding the problem and the dataset, and I've
            shown you the first three techniques I encountered when it comes to
            handling missing values.
