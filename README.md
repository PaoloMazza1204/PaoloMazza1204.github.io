# Machine Learning Portfolio

I'm currently taking a machine learning course, and this is the portfolio where I'm going to upload my ML projects. You can take a look at it [here](https://paolomazza1204.github.io/).

## Current status - 🚧 WIP 🚧 🔨👷🏼‍♂️

At the moment, the portfolio contains the following two sections.

### First Steps 👣

In this section I'll upload my first steps in machine learning. For now, it just contains the page Data Preprocessing.

### Case Studies 🔎

In this section I'll upload my case studies. For now, it just contains the page Prediction of Titanic Survivors.
